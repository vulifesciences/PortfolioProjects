## This is where you can find out about project ideas on offer for your portfolio submission.
Project offers will be posted and updateed here regularly both by fellow students or locals in your scientific community who are looking for your collaboration. 

Each project posting will include descriptions for the project, the professional skills you will develop, as well as how to demonstrate evidence of process and feedback throughout.

I wish you lots of success in finding, designing and carrying out an interesting project!
