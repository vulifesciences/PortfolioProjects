#### This is where you can read more about portfolio project ideas.
Project offers will be posted here and updated regularly both by fellow students in the course or locals in your scientific community, who might be looking for your input or collaboration. 

Each project posting should include a descriptions of the project and outline the professional skills you will develop. It will also elaborate on how to demonstrate evidence of process and feedback.

I wish you lots of success in finding, designing and carrying out an interesting project!
